# Racket-1
The purpose of this programming exercise is to learn the basic functional programming paradigm and become comfortable using recursion. 
In this homework, you are to create a number of Scheme functions. You are to follow a strict function programming style. 
That means you need to follow the style we used in class and use only functions, parameters, and recursion.
You may write any helper functions you need, and you may use functions created for one problem to solve another.
Please do not use built in Scheme functions except the ones (and variants of them) we used in class: car, cdr (and all their variants), cons, null?, pair?, list?, number?, append, =, eq?, zero?, if, cond, and all the standard arithmetic and logic functions.


Do not nest cond statements. Nor have more than two if statements nested inside each other. Instead, rearrange your logic so that you can write your function with a single cond of multiple cases.

You can assume all input is in the proper format.
